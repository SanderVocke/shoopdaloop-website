ShoopDaLoop is a cross-platform, FOSS advanced live looping application that is unfortunately not yet finished.

However, development is out in the open and there is a lot that already works. Curious? Have a look or grab an early build at [the project GitHub](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop) and/or have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.shoopdaloop.com).

Happy looping!
