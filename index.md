ShoopDaLoop is a cross-platform, FOSS advanced live looping application that is unfortunately not yet finished.

However, development is out in the open and there is a lot that already works. For now, ShoopDaLoop needs to run within a [JACK Audio](https://jackaudio.org) session, which for Linux users will be nothing new, but for Win/MacOS users may take a bit of time to get used to.

Curious? Have a look or grab an early build at [the project GitHub](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop) and/or have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.shoopdaloop.com).

I am looking forward to your thoughts, ideas and bug reports.

Happy looping!
