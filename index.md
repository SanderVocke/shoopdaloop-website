ShoopDaLoop is a cross-platform, FOSS advanced live looping application that is unfortunately not yet finished.

However, development is out in the open and there is a lot that already works. For now, ShoopDaLoop needs to run within a [JACK Audio](https://jackaudio.org) session, which for Linux users will be nothing new, but for Win/MacOS users may take a bit of time to get used to.

Curious? Have a look or grab an early build of [the latest development release](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop/releases/latest) and/or have a look at the [documentation](https://docs.shoopdaloop.com) or [source code](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop).

I am looking forward to your [thoughts, ideas, demos](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop/discussions) and [bug reports](https://github.com/SanderVocke/shoopdaloop/issues).

Happy looping!
